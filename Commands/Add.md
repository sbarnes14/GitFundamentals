# git add 
When changes have been made inside a git repository that you want to keep, you'll need to use the `git add` command. 

Items that have not been "tracked" before will start to be tracked and all other changes will be marked as modified. 

Genrally, you can get away with the commands `git add.` which will add all files and directories that were added, changed, or delted. 

you can track changes to specific files using `git add file1 file2` which will track specifically file1 and file2.

you can specifiy tracking directories with `git add DirectoryName`
