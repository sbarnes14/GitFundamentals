# git pull

Similar to the [git push](./Push,md), a `git pull` will interact with a repository.
Only this time it will **pull** the changes it does not have from the remote down to the local repository. 

This means any commits made that are on the remore Repository will be pulled down and added to the local repository 

This can be done by adding the remote name and branch name:
```
gti pull origin main
```

If tghere is any upstream connection established, you can use `git pull` without specifying a remote or branch.
